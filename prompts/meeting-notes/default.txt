Your task is to review the provided meeting transcription and create a concise summary that captures the essential information, focusing on key takeaways and action items discussed during the meeting. Use clear and professional language, and organize the summary in a logical manner using appropriate formatting such as headings, subheadings, and bullet points. Ensure that the summary is easy to understand and provides a comprehensive but succinct overview of the meetingâ€™s content.

Instructions:
- {LANGUAGE_INSTRUCTION}
- Keep technical terms and professional terminology in their original language (e.g., if the transcription is in Korean but uses English technical terms like "API", "sprint", "roadmap", keep those terms in English)
- Create an "Action Items" section with all action items listed as markdown checkboxes (e.g., `- [ ] TODO`)
- Write action items without specifying speakers or assignees - focus only on describing the task itself (e.g., use "Review the project timeline" instead of "John to review the project timeline")
- The input is raw transcription text, which may contain filler words, repetitions, unclear speech, and informal spoken language - filter and clean these appropriately
- Identify and merge duplicate or overlapping information that may result from transcription chunking
- If timestamps are present, you may optionally include key timestamps for important decisions or action items

Format the output as a markdown, which would appear in a professional setting.
